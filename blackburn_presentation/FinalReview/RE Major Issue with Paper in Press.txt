Hey Jason and John,

Sorry for the delay on this.  Please the attached revised manuscript.  As you will see, we 
have removed all of the “strong” language associated with overfishing and population 
declines.  Any text that focuses on population declines and overfishing has been 
tempered to acknowledge our uncertainty.  You will also notice that we did not add 
extensive text on confidence intervals.  I’m not convinced such a discussion is 
necessary.  Also, we need to minimize the number of changes since this manuscript has 
already been reviewed extensively by all of the co-authors, and has been through journal 
and USGS review processes.  Anyway, we hope you are happy with the edits—we really 
do believe the revised version addresses Kevin’s concerns .  Given that NAJFM is 
waiting on this paper, please give this a review ASAP and we’ll get it back into the 
system.  As always, please let Shannon or I know if you have any questions, concerns, or 
additional comments.

Many thanks,
Mike

Thank you Michael, we understand that this is not the ideal way to go about this, and we should have 
had better communication before this point. However, we have no choice in this situation. We will 
gladly work with you on the language we have concerns with. Please work with Jason DuBois and John 
Kelly directly, cc’d above.

Dan

Hello all, I am currently traveling (just finished teaching a pop dynamics workshop for the state 
of Utah) and saw this.  I think it's important to say that Shannon and I worked very closely with 
CDFW at every step in this project, including drafting and editing the manuscript.  Working 
closely with agencies is something I and my students take pride in.  I've never experienced 
anything like this and, to be honest, I'm a little confused.  Having said that, I do not like the idea 
of removing authors because, as stated above, they all contributed greatly to the work.  I think 
the best option is to temper the language as suggested.  That should be quite easy to do.  I have 
contacted NAJFM with the request to "pause" the paper (assuming that can still be done).  I 
corresponded with the EIC and he also asked the staff to hit the pause button.  Shannon is going 
to work on tempering the language and we should have something ready by next week.  My 
apologies for any confusion, but CDFW did contribute to all stages of this work including review 
of the manuscript. 
 
Take care, 
Mike

Subject: Major Issue with Paper in Press 
 
Hi Shannon and Daniel,
       I am the Supervisor for the Statewide Sturgeon Program with the California Department of Fish 
and Wildlife.  We need to discuss a critical issue with a paper that is currently in Press: Population 
Dynamics and Evaluation of Management Scenarios for White Sturgeon in the Sacramento–San Joaquin 
River Basin. Two of the co-authors are from CDFW, however one retired during the review process for 
this paper and it is not clear if CDFW was able to give comments on a specific aspect of this publication. 
Specifically, there is concern with the following statement and the general conclusion that it presents, 
within the paper. 
 
“White Sturgeon in the SSJ exhibited fast growth, high rates of mortality, and high levels of exploitation, 
and the population appeared to be declining. The size structure and age structure of the population 
suggest that the White Sturgeon population in the SSJ is overexploited.” 
 
       Based on CDFW’s current understanding of the paper and the model, the confidence intervals 
around the population estimate of ? are quite large. The concern with the paper as written is that the 
confidence intervals in almost all cases incorporate values both greater and less than 1.  Because of that, 
even though the estimates of ? may suggest population declines, it’s hard to make that definitive 
statement and be confident it is accurate.  Statistically, it’s possible that the estimates may be much 
better (or much worse) than reported. With this understanding of the model outputs, the quoted 
statement above becomes problematic. As currently written, CDFW is unable to maintain co-authorship 
and would need to have authors names and or affiliations removed from the paper. If the CDFW is to 
remain as listed authors of this paper we need to have a discussion about altering this language. We 
have no issue with the empirical outputs or construction of the model, however, we disagree with the 
assertion that this model clearly indicates that the population is overexploited. The CDFW strives to be 
up front about the reality of fish population modeling and what the outputs of those models mean. We 
would like to have a discussion about this and believe there is an alternate solution by changing the 
conclusion from the definitive of overexploitation to a discussion about the size of the confidence 
intervals and what exactly that may mean. I am happy to arrange a conference call with everyone and 
begin this discussion.
 
I know this comes as a late request, but it is imperative that we can find a resolution to this issue quickly 
to minimize delays in the publication process. Thank for you understanding in this matter. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Daniel Kratville
