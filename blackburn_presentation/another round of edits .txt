Hello, 

Attached is another version of the paper that came to be my thesis. I have made some modifications from 
the thesis, but nothing major. If you could read this again and provide any additional edits, feedbacks, and 
comments, that would be most appreciated. We are hoping to submit this in the coming weeks, so ideally 
I could have edits back before October 10th. Thank you again for all your help.  

Cheers, 
Shannon
