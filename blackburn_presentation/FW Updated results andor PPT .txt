FYI Jason and Andrew.

Great answer Shannon and neat update.

It'd be great to move Slide 35 into the presentation, because we are really (really) trying to get folks to 
focus on that cohort.

Does the new vertical dashed line in Slides 26, 28, and 30 represent the cumulative average exploitation 
rate of 13.6%?

My rationale for lumping the 3 years of sampling data together is that it (possibly) represents a more 
accurate portrayal of the population's age/size structure. Although White Sturgeon are known not to 
exhibit a stable age distribution and be dominated to a periodic, rare, strong cohorts, the combo of data 
helps buffer skewed distributions due to variation in individual fish size and sampling efforts. Also, the 
mortality estimators we use (i.e., catch-curve, Chapman-Robson) assume constant recruitment, which 
sturgeon obviously violate.

I also estimated instantaneous natural mortality (M) using a couple other equations that use water 
temperature data, maximum age of fish, and the estimated growth parameters. The results was similar 
for the estimates we used in the base model (A = 18.7%). I did however, vary M, and thus total annual 
mortality (A) between 15% and 30% to see how different levels of mortality affect the population 
growth rate, because we likely overestimated A.

Hi Shannon,

Can you share any more updated results or your latest thinking on the PPT?

I'm really interested in what you've learned about the rationale for 'lumping' more than one year of 
length- or age-frequencies into a single distribution.  When we've done that, we 'shift' the ages to 
account for the sampling year and say the plot is about 'brood year' or similar.

Thanks
