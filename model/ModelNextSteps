Sent to Joe Ferreira "model-current.html". Hope to discuss with him shortly his perspective about the model.

Outlining steps to fully understand model & to automate (or) streamline Shannon's code

Aside from the 4 datasets (below) are there any others that 'feed' the model?
1. initial_age_dist
2. prob_survival_obs
3. prob_spawn
4. number_eggs

Understand how to calculate exploitation (mu) adjusting for non-reporting, tag loss, and tagging mortality. Also, employ VBGM to apply appropriate inclusion or cutoff for fish that could be harvested (i.e., legal size) during the year at large post tagging.

Develop ALKEY from n=374 aged fish. Since these fish were from the study period (i.e., 2014-2016) I assume these fish are not passed into the ALKEY, but rather added to the total post application of key to non-aged fish.

Develop an easy way to set survival accross ages using Chapman-Robson (peak+1); this gets at the data in prob_survival_obs.

Understand which packages --- if any --- Shannon used are an absolute must. That is, it would be way too tedious to write my own code. If such packages are needed, maybe it's time to employ Packrat?

Figure out the best way to write custom functions for this model; perhaps even think about containing everything in a package...might be easier. Remember, I need to apply this to Striped Bass too!

Make sure I am clear on which data came from the literature and give citations accordingly.

Develop a clear roadmap of the flow needed to get to final figure (output; lambda ~ exploitation)

Figure out a good way to employ Millar's code for gear selectivity.

Plotting: Intermediate steps? Final output? (Nice base R or ggplot?)
