## Project Overview

This project is a collaborative effort between the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and the University of Idaho (College of Natural Resources). The overall purpose is to develop a population model for White Sturgeon inhabiting the anadromous waters of the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). Ultimately, this goal is to use this model in the management of the White Sturgeon fishery.
