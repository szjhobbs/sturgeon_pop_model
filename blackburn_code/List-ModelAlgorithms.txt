Below is an initial list of algorithms used in the model. This list is just an off-the-top-of-my-head list and may not include everything the model needs. The idea is to eventually take these algorithms and create custom functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mortality

exploitation (per literature, and adjusting for tag loss, tag mortality, non-reporting)

growth (per von Bertalanffy, and how employed in mortality - i.e., growth into & out of the slot limit)

fecundity (use of devore-champman)

selectivity (Millar code)

age (age-length key, back calculation, etc.)

maturity (probability of, etc.)

matrix (design of leslie matrix)

output (many!)
