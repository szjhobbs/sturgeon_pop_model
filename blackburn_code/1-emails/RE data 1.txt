Hi Shannon,

We are coordinating with the Fisheries Branch statistician on your model.  There is a kind of contract 
management nexus, such that that coordination should remove any additional 'pressure' for you to 
coordinate with them.   To finish that coordination, we need the remaining data and code.  Specifically 
what data and code is left for you to send Jason?  When do you plan to send that stuff?

Thanks
