Hello, 

I went through and triple-checked everything. The issues I found are in the second spreadsheet labeled 
issues. Hopefully everything makes sense. There are two fish I wasn’t able to consolidated. In our ageing 
database, I haven’t matched up fish 51 (fork length 99 cm, captured 8/7/14) and fish 3112 (fork length 
98 cm, captured 8/19/15). 

For the couple fork lengths that did not match, I just went with what was in the CDFW sturgeon 
database for now as I do not have the datasheets. It was usually just a cm off or so.
