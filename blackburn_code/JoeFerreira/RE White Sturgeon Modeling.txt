Marty

Attached is some notes I made on the attachment you sent me.  In general, I don’t have enough info to 
comment on the modeling work they did as the file you gave me is very high level.

If you have more details on the modeling process I may be able to make better comments


Regards

Joe

Hi Joe,

DFW let out a contract with University of Idaho (a MS student and her professor) to work with us to 
model the population trajectory of white sturgeon.  The model uses some data from the literature and 
lots of our own data.  The contract is about to end, the student is about to finish her thesis, and we are 
presenting some aspects of the work.  My hope is that you'll take a look at the model and engage us --- 
Jason on the very-technical stuff --- about your ideas and any concerns about the model.  

The student is very busy and the model is not organized for easy review, but Jason has been working to 
tidy it up for our purposes.  If you want took take a look at what Jason has before he's done with it, feel 
free and encouraged.  Otherwise, let's postpone another week or two.  Either way, I've attached the 
most-recent presentation so the three of us can talk about it when you are ready/interested.

The model shows that the if recruitment patterns and fishing stays as they have been for about 40 years, 
then (1) population trajectory is downward and (2) cohorts being harvested now will be greatly 
diminished.  Neither of those are good news or surprising.  

Thanks
