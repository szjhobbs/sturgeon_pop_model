Marty, thank you for the response and clarification.  

Some more questions on slides #15,17 and 20  (see below in blue)

Regards

Joe

Hi Joe,

Thanks for taking a gander and and posing questions about the presentation.  Jason hasn't been able to 
work full speed on stringing together the components of Shannon's model so it'd be easiest for you to 
look into, but he's making great progress and it should be soon.  

W/regard to your comments and questions on the presentation:

Slide 5:  
It is relative abundance.  
See this for the method:  https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentId=26542
Data is from our Bay Study otter trawl
It is based on a consistent process over the entire time period presented.

Slide 6:
Agreed, it's problematic that we issue more tags for fish than there are fish in the legal-sized population.  
However, the harvest is 'only' upwards of 15% of that population a year because the fish are relatively 
hard to come by.  I write ''only' because that's a huge fraction for this population.

Slide 8: 
Data for only a couple of years is sufficient, because the demographics and fishery do not change very 
fast. 
It's enough to study Suisun Bay, because the fish move around a lot and come through there to spawn in 
(mostly) the Sacramento.

Slide 9:  
Trammel netting is the best way to sample.  Hook and line is grossly inefficient and selective.  There is no 
other way.
We'd love to do more, but sampling intensity and locations are what can be managed and the 
interpretation is pretty cut-and-dried.  We also have multiple lines of evidence for much of it and it's all 
consistent.
The 87 cm criteria is what we've decided is reasonable, based on what we tag-return data is most 
important for (i.e., estimating exploitation).

Slide 11:  
It's old data but all that's available and should be fine.  We'd like to re-do the field study.  We'd like to 
run the model while varying estimated maturity.  There are more than eight points, and I'm not sure 
why she showed it that way.  Here is the paper:  
ftp://ftp.wildlife.ca.gov/Adult_Sturgeon_and_Striped_Bass/White%20sturgeon%20reproductive%20con
dition%20California%201996.pdf

Slide 12:  Using data from the Columbia should be fine.  'Fish is fish' in this regard, where volume is 
reliably proportional to length.

Slide 14:  Pretty sure they did not treat it as a point estimate.  There is though little survival data to be 
had.

Slide 15:  I'm not sure what you means "insufficient info to judge the modeling process".  She ran many 
more scenarios, but I think reporting these is sufficient. 
what I am referring to is that on this slide, it shows covariates (ie ingredients) to an output (ie growth I 
presume), but there is no telling how these covariates are related in a functional form to the output.   Its 
like showing me that they used flour, eggs and milk and the output was a cake, but I have not idea how 
those ingredients were used to create the cake.

Slide 17:   Taking a fin ray is pretty violent, so we only took a subset.  We can use an age-length key of 
other model to assign ages, but that would be 'circular' for the present purposes.   
A sample fin rays from 374 sturgeons were used to estimate the age, but the remaining 636 no fin rays 
were taken, so what method was used to estimate the age for those 636 sturgeons.  Your response says 
you can used ALK.  I was asking if that is what was used or what method was used to estimate age for 
the 636 that did not have fin rays taken?

Slide 18:  Yes, that's the entire l-f distribution.

Slide 19:  Those are modeled ages.

Slide 20:  Agreed.  There is only so much data and there are very (very) few big fish.  She tinkered with 
this.  From a management perspective, I believe the difference in the trends and the absolute values is 
unimportant.
I understand that data is limited; my only point is that since data is scarce in the extreme (large and 
small) that can generate wildly different models depending on what is available there.

Slide 24:  Correct about tainting due to scoff-law anglers.  It is what it is.  The values are plausible and we 
account for the issues when interpreting them.

Slide 26:  Yes, we hope you will look at the specific models. You are right about what it is though.

Take care

Attached is some notes I made on the attachment you sent me.  In general, I don’t have enough info to 
comment on the modeling work they did as the file you gave me is very high level.

If you have more details on the modeling process I may be able to make better comments


Regards

Hi Joe,

DFW let out a contract with University of Idaho (a MS student and her professor) to work with us to 
model the population trajectory of white sturgeon.  The model uses some data from the literature and 
lots of our own data.  The contract is about to end, the student is about to finish her thesis, and we are 
presenting some aspects of the work.  My hope is that you'll take a look at the model and engage us --- 
Jason on the very-technical stuff --- about your ideas and any concerns about the model.

The student is very busy and the model is not organized for easy review, but Jason has been working to 
tidy it up for our purposes.  If you want took take a look at what Jason has before he's done with it, feel 
free and encouraged.  Otherwise, let's postpone another week or two.  Either way, I've attached the 
most-recent presentation so the three of us can talk about it when you are ready/interested.

The model shows that the if recruitment patterns and fishing stays as they have been for about 40 years, 
then (1) population trajectory is downward and (2) cohorts being harvested now will be greatly 
diminished.  Neither of those are good news or surprising.

Thanks

Let me know when it would be a good time for you to talk about the request you are making.

Best for me is either tomorrow 9-11, or Thursday 9-11 or 1-3
