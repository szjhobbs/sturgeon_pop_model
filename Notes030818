Notes with Shannon (meeting 03-08-18 @ 1345 Stockton)

Used CDFW 2014-2016 (n= ~1000), of these 374 aged using fin rays
(Shannon will send this data - the age length stuff)


initial age dist -
binned by length (5 cm bins) then applied alkey (n=374), got proportion in each age category, then scaled to 48K



prob of survival
age 0 - age 2 --> from literature

age 3 - age 9 --> applied conditional natural mortaility, see Ricker page 11 (S = 0.835265413)
age 10 - age 15 --> chapman robson with age9 (ages 9:19), s/b 0.7108262 despite data in prob_survival_obs
age 16+ --> same as age3-age9

prob_survival_obs is just a starting point the stochastic element of the model will "move" survival rate up or down accordingly.

prob of reproduction

used chapman data from digitized graph
running glm as binomial (either mature or not)
Shannon will send data

need to be mature then multiplied by 0.10 or 0.15 or 0.25 (for different periods)


Post breeding census, not pre-breeding (perhaps look into pre-breeding census)



number of eggs 
equation from devore
